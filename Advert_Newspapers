## 2-way ANOVA to check the variance in Advertising in Local Newspapers
#### Data available at the link: "http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/brase/understandable_statistics/7e/students/datasets/twan/frames/frame.html"
#### Response: Number of inquiries resulting from advertisement
#### Factor 1:	day of week (Monday through Friday)
#### Factor 2:	section of newspaper (news, business, sports)
news <- read.csv("twan04.csv",h=T)
#### Let's define a proper order for the factor variable Day. By default the level order would be scrambled.
news$Day <- factor(news$Day, levels = c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thrusday","Friday"))
#### Format the data properly
advertisement <- as.vector(sapply(news[,2:4],rbind))
type <- c(rep("News",nrow(news)),rep("Business",nrow(news)),rep("Sport",nrow(news)))
day <- rep(c("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thrusday","Friday"),each = 4,times = 3)
news_formatted <- data.frame(cbind(advertisement,type,day))
news_formatted$advertisement <- as.numeric(as.character(news_formatted$advertisement))
#### Now we can apply the anova function
plot.design(news_formatted)
tapply(news_formatted$advertisement,type,mean)
tapply(news_formatted$advertisement,day,mean)
interaction.plot(news_formatted$day,news_formatted$type,news_formatted$advertisement,col=c("red","blue","yellow"))
#### From the graph it is easy to see there is a cross between the lines, that means only variance of the interaction term should be considered into account regarding the variance of the dependent variable.
model <- aov(advertisement ~ type + day + type:day, data=news_formatted)
#### Since there is a significant effect of the interaction term whose F value is larger then F-critical, we then must consider exclusively the interaction term and not considering individual term.

plot(residuals(model2))
boxplot(residuals(model2)~type*day)
#### Residuals are distributed around zero with constant variance.
