## COX-BOX
#### Data are available form the basic R package
data(pressure)
str(pressure)
plot(pressure$temperature,pressure$pressure)
#### The plot highlight a clear nonliner regression. The relationship is a curve that can be expressed by Log tranformation.
#### Temperature is in celsius degree. Pression is in mercury 
pressure$temperature<-(pressure$temperature+273)
linearModel <- lm(pressure ~ temperature, pressure)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(linearModel)
#### Looking at the residuals plot, residuals vs y-hat does not follow a normal distribution (parabolic) and that does not satisfy one or more assumptions of ordinary least squares regression(Gauss_MaÃ rkov)
#### We could use Log tranformation but for this exercise we can want to use Cox-Box that is a more generic function that could be used in multiple situation.
library(MASS)
boxcox(linearModel,lambda=seq(0,1,by=0.1))
temp<-boxcox(linearModel,lambda=seq(0,1,by=0.1))
boxcox<-data.frame(cbind(x=temp$x,y=temp$y))
#### lambda is the value which maximezes the log-likelyhood.
lambda<-boxcox[which(max(boxcox$y)==boxcox$y),]$x
#### Base on CoxBox assumptions, z is now the new function.
#### Since lambda is pretty close to 0, we usethe function Log(y)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(log(pressure) ~ temperature,data= pressure)
linearModel <- lm(log(pressure) ~ temperature, pressure)
skewness(lm(log(pressure) ~ temperature, pressure)$residuals)
#### skewness = 0.7 is not a very good result, but we couldn't find anything better.
#### Other options like the ones belowe didn't provide anything better.
plot(density(lm(log(pressure) ~ temperature, pressure)$residuals))
#### residuals are still a little left skewed.
#### Other options like the ones reported belowe didn't provide anything better.
skewness(linearModelCoxBox<-lm(log(pressure) ~ I(temperature^2),data= pressure)$res)
skewness(linearModelCoxBox<-lm(log(pressure) ~ I(1/temperature),data= pressure)$res)
skewness(linearModelCoxBox<-lm(log(pressure) ~ sqrt(temperature),data= pressure)$res)
skewness(linearModelCoxBox<-lm(log(pressure) ~ log(temperature),data= pressure)$res)
#### The model the smallest skew is 
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(density(linearModelCoxBox<-lm(log(pressure) ~ temperature,data= pressure)$res))
plot(density(linearModelCoxBox<-lm(log(pressure) ~ log(temperature),data= pressure)$res)))
summary(lm(log(pressure) ~ log(temperature),data= pressure))
#### Residual standard error: 0.5734 on 17 degrees of freedom
#### Multiple R-squared:  0.9853,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.9845 
#### F-statistic:  1143 on 1 and 17 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
